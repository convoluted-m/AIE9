    "Before diving into agents, let's understand the fundamental building blocks of LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Runnable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Runnable** is the core abstraction in LangChain - think of it as a standardized component that:\n",
    "- Takes an input\n",
    "- Performs some operation\n",
    "- Returns an output\n",
    "\n",
    "Every component in LangChain (models, prompts, retrievers, parsers) is a Runnable, which means they all share the same interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = runnable.invoke(input)           # Single input\n",
    "results = runnable.batch([input1, input2]) # Multiple inputs\n",
    "for chunk in runnable.stream(input):       # Streaming\n",
    "    print(chunk)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LCEL** allows you to chain Runnables together using the `|` (pipe) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = prompt | model | output_parser\n",
    "result = chain.invoke({\"query\": \"Hello!\"})\n",

    "How does **Agentic RAG** differ from traditional RAG? What are the advantages and potential disadvantages of letting the agent decide when to retrieve information?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "Traditional RAG contains a fixed \"query → retrieve→ generate” logic while in agentic RAG, the agent controls when and how to retrieve information/ use  tools. Agentic RAG is flexible so it can solve problems \"creatively\", e.g. run the loop multiple times it if decides it doesn't have enough info to complete a task, use multiple tools in a loop, or even not retrieve info at all if not needed. However, if limits are not set (like we did here with middleware), agentic RAG can  result in higher number of calls and hence costs and potentially looping forever in order to achieve the goal.\n"

    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "For example, in a customer service solution, I would use middleware for: 1) observability to track all the steps and help with debugging and evaluation; perhaps to track metrics too like resolution time (before and after model call, and before and after tool execution); 2) guardrails to ensure no irrelevant/harmful input is being fed into the loop if out of scope/toxic (before model call) and that the output fits the established criteria of relevance, safety, etc. (after model call); 3) PII redaction of sensitive customer data (before model call) 4) routing to appropriate tools, e.g. cheaper models or ML classifiers for simple queries and LLMs for more complex/contextual queries and fallbacks; 5)the rate limit to control the costs (before tool execution) 6) human in the loop for, e.g. account cancellations, high value transactions, multiple failed attempt escalations."

      "You’re not alone in feeling that way. For context, at 55 kg and 170 cm your BMI is about 19.0, which is within the healthy range—just on the lean side. If your goal is to look and feel stronger, focusing on building muscle and gaining weight slowly is a great plan.\n",

The knowledge base covers the roles of macronutrients (protein for muscle repair, carbs for energy, fats for hormone production) even though it doesn’t specify gram targets [Source 3].\n",
