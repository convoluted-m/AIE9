    "Having separate states helps to manage and isolate context and improve task execution. It's been shown that LLMs experience context bloat - if a lot of information is added to the context, the models get confused and their performance worsens. Introducing hierarchy of states means one agent doesn't have to maintain all the context but can focus on specific sub-topics ,e.g. the subagent researcher can focus on doing deep research while the supervisor can focus on coordinating research work. Some tasks can be also done in parallel such as sub research, which is more efficient. The states are interrelated because selected data flows down through the agent hierarchy in a structured manner.\n",

       "Research demonstrates that consistent sleep schedules are fundamental to health and performance. The National Sleep Foundation's 2023 consensus guidelines emphasize that maintaining the same bedtime and wake-up time within 30 minutes, including weekends, is associated with improved outcomes across multiple health dimensions including alertness, cardiovascular and metabolic health, inflammation, and mental health [1][2].\n",
       "\n",
       "Your current 3-hour window of bedtime variability (10pm-1am) significantly impacts your circadian rhythms. A study of college students found that irregular sleepers showed delayed melatonon onset by 2.6 hours, later peak sleep propensity, and more daytime sleep episodes compared to regular sleepers. Despite sleeping the same total duration, irregular sleepers had lower academic performance, with each 10-point increase in sleep regularity associated with a 0.10 increase in GPA [3].\n",

       "### Implementation Strategy for Consistent Sleep Timing\n",
       "\n",
       "**Phase 1: Choose Your Target Schedule (Week 1)**\n",
       "- Select a realistic bedtime between 10:30pm-11:00pm that allows for 7-9 hours of sleep\n",
       "- Choose a consistent wake time that works with your schedule\n",
       "- Use the gradual adjustment method: shift your current bedtime earlier by 15-20 minutes every 2-3 nights until you reach your target\n",
       "\n",
       "**Phase 2: Strengthen Circadian Anchors (Weeks 2-4)**\n",
       "- Get natural sunlight exposure within 30 minutes of waking to reset your internal clock\n",
       "- Maintain your schedule within 30 minutes, even on weekends (limited \"social jetlag\")\n",
       "- If you must have catch-up sleep, limit it to 1-2 additional hours on weekends, as recent research shows this can be beneficial for recovering from sleep debt [2]\n",

       "Recent large-scale studies provide compelling evidence about screen time's impact on sleep. Research of nearly 40,000 Norwegian university students found that each additional hour of screen time after going to bed increased insomnia symptoms by 59% and reduced sleep by an average of 24 minutes per night [9]. A parallel U.S. study showed that people using screens before bed had a 33% higher rate of poor sleep quality and slept approximately 50 minutes less per week [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "Your phone use in bed is particularly problematic. A study of Saudi Arabian adults found that 95.1% had smartphones in bedrooms, with regular smartphone use associated with nearly double the risk of very poor sleep quality (OR 1.98) [10].\n",

       "\n",
       "**The 10-3-2-1-0 Method**\n",
       "This research-backed approach provides a structured wind-down routine [6]:\n",
       "- **10 hours before bed**: No caffeine\n",
       "- **3 hours before bed**: No alcohol or heavy meals  \n",
       "- **2 hours before bed**: Stop work-related activities\n",
       "- **1 hour before bed**: No screens (this is your key intervention point)\n",
       "- **0**: No snooze button in the morning\n",
       "\n",

       "- Light household tasks\n",
       "\n",
       "### Blue Light Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "While newer research suggests blue light may have less impact than previously believed, the behavioral and cognitive arousal from phone use remains problematic [7]. The issue isn't just the light—it's the mental stimulation, social media engagement, and the conditioned association between your bed and wakefulness.\n",

       "## Morning Alertness and Fatigue Reduction\n",
       "\n",
       "### Understanding Sleep Inertia\n",
       "\n",
       "Your morning fatigue likely stems from sleep inertia—the grogginess, disorientation, and cognitive impairment immediately following waking. This typically lasts 15-60 minutes but can extend for hours, especially when awakening from deep (slow-wave) sleep [15].\n",
       "\n",
       "Research shows sleep inertia can severely impair performance—sometimes worse than losing an entire night of sleep. The key insight is that sleep inertia is far more likely when someone is suddenly awakened from deep sleep phases [14].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Evidence-Based Morning Alertness Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate Post-Wake Strategies (0-20 minutes)**\n",
       "1. **Light exposure**: Get bright light (ideally natural sunlight) within the first 30 minutes of waking. A randomized study found that light-emitting interventions significantly improved alertness and energy levels compared to control conditions [11]\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Strategic caffeine timing**: If you use caffeine, research shows it's most effective when consumed immediately upon waking rather than waiting. Consider caffeinated chewing gum for faster absorption than pills [13]\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Avoid critical decisions**: Wait at least 20 minutes before making important decisions or performing safety-critical activities like driving [12]\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sleep Architecture Optimization**\n",
       "- **Nap strategically**: Keep naps to 10-15 minutes or extend to ~90 minutes to avoid awakening from deep sleep\n",
       "- **Avoid the snooze button**: Research shows repeated snooze button use can trigger sleep inertia episodes [14]\n",
       "- **Time your sleep cycles**: Aim for sleep durations that align with 90-minute cycles (6, 7.5, or 9 hours) to increase chances of waking during lighter sleep phases\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pre-Sleep Strategies to Improve Morning Alertness**\n",
       "- Plan your sleep duration to avoid nighttime awakenings\n",
       "- Ensure adequate prior sleep (avoid sleep debt accumulation)\n",
       "- Consider a \"coffee nap\": consuming caffeine before a 20-minute nap can reduce post-nap grogginess\n",
       "\n",
       "## Sleep Environment Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "### Temperature Control\n",
       "\n",
       "The ideal bedroom temperature for optimal sleep is 65-68°F (18-20°C), with 65°F being the most commonly cited optimal temperature [4][1]. This cooler setting helps maintain the natural drop in core body temperature that occurs during sleep onset. Adults sleeping in optimized temperature environments report up to 73% better sleep quality according to National Sleep Foundation data [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Light Management Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "Circadian rhythms are heavily influenced by light exposure patterns. Natural light during the day promotes cortisol production for alertness, while darkness triggers melatonin production for sleepiness [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Evening Light Control**:\n",
       "- Light levels above 10 lux in the evening can reduce slow-wave sleep and increase nighttime awakenings\n",
       "- Install blackout curtains or room-darkening shades\n",
       "- Cover LED lights on electronic devices\n",
       "- Use dim, warm lighting (under 10 lux) for evening activities\n",
       "\n",
       "**Morning Light Exposure**:\n",
       "- Natural sunlight within 30 minutes of waking helps reset circadian rhythms\n",
       "- If natural light isn't available, consider a light therapy device (2,000+ lux)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sound Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "Noise disruptions prevent deeper sleep stages, with sounds as low as 33 decibels affecting sleep quality. Loud noise disturbances can cause severe sleep fragmentation with negative impacts on physical and mental health [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sound Management Strategies**:\n",
       "- Use earplugs, white noise machines, or fans for consistent background sound\n",
       "- Consider pink noise, which a 2017 study found increased deep sleep and improved memory in older adults [1]\n",
       "- Address partner-related noise issues (snoring, movement)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Additional Environmental Factors\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bedding and Mattress**: Newer mattresses can improve sleep quality and reduce back pain. Regular bedding maintenance (washing sheets at least every two weeks) reduces dust mites and promotes hygiene [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Air Quality and Scents**: Some studies have found lavender essential oil can improve sleep quality and morning refreshment. Ensure good ventilation and consider air purification if needed [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Additional Proven Sleep Interventions\n",
       "\n",
       "### Relaxation and Wind-Down Techniques\n",
       "\n",
       "**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**\n",
       "This \"relaxing breath\" method involves:\n",
       "- Inhaling for 4 counts\n",
       "- Holding for 7 counts  \n",
       "- Exhaling for 8 counts\n",
       "- Repeating 4 times\n",
       "\n",
       "A 2022 study showed this technique creates immediate heart rate variability changes and blood pressure reductions by shifting toward parasympathetic nervous system activation [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Progressive Muscle Relaxation**\n",
       "Reserve the hour before bed for winding down with activities like:\n",
       "- Progressive muscle relaxation\n",
       "- Gentle stretching\n",
       "- Warm baths\n",
       "- Light reading (physical books only)\n",
       "- Deep breathing exercises\n",
       "\n",
       "### Stimulus Control Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "Use your bed only for sleep and sex to create proper sleep associations. This is a core component of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), the first-line treatment for chronic sleep problems [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Implementation**:\n",
       "- No work, eating, or entertainment in bed\n",
       "- If unable to fall asleep within 20-30 minutes, get up and move to another room\n",
       "- Return to bed only when feeling sleepy\n",
       "- Maintain consistent wake times regardless of sleep quality the previous night\n",
       "\n",
       "### Substance Management Guidelines\n",
       "\n",
       "**Caffeine**: Research shows caffeine consumption after 3 PM significantly prohibits restful sleep by prolonging sleep onset time, limiting sleep depth, and increasing sleep disturbances [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Alcohol**: While alcohol may initially cause drowsiness, it suppresses REM sleep during initial sleep cycles and leads to increased wake time and disturbances in later cycles [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Timing Recommendations**:\n",
       "- Last caffeine intake: 10 hours before bedtime\n",
       "- Last alcohol consumption: 3 hours before bedtime\n",
       "- Heavy meals: Complete 3 hours before bedtime\n",
       "\n",
       "## Implementation Timeline and Expected Results\n",
       "\n",
       "### Week 1: Foundation Setting\n",
       "- Choose target bedtime and wake time\n",
       "- Remove phone from bedroom\n",
       "- Begin temperature optimization\n",
       "- Start 4-7-8 breathing practice\n",
       "\n",
       "### Weeks 2-3: Habit Reinforcement  \n",
       "- Fine-tune sleep schedule using gradual adjustment\n",
       "- Implement full 10-3-2-1-0 protocol\n",
       "- Establish morning light exposure routine\n",
       "- Practice stimulus control consistently\n",
       "\n",
       "### Weeks 4-6: Optimization and Consistency\n",
       "- Address any remaining environmental factors\n",
       "- Solidify weekend schedule maintenance\n",
       "- Evaluate and adjust based on sleep quality improvements\n",
       "- Consider advanced interventions if needed\n",
       "\n",
       "### Expected Timeline for Results\n",
       "\n",
       "Research indicates that many people notice initial improvements within 1-2 weeks of implementing consistent sleep hygiene routines. A study of bedtime routine implementation found the most significant improvements occurred within the first three nights, with sleep onset latency decreasing by an average of 1.29 minutes per night during this period [12].\n",
       "\n",
       "By the end of two weeks, participants experienced:\n",
       "- Over 6 minutes reduction in time to fall asleep\n",
       "- Over one hour increase in longest consolidated sleep period  \n",
       "- Reduction in night wakings from over one per night to less than one per night\n",
       "\n",
       "Full benefits typically develop over several weeks, especially when incorporating stimulus control and sleep restriction elements from CBT-I approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "### When to Seek Additional Help\n",
       "\n",
       "If you don't see improvements after 4-6 weeks of consistent implementation, consider:\n",
       "- Consultation with a sleep medicine specialist\n",
       "- Evaluation for underlying sleep disorders\n",
       "- Formal Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)\n",
       "- Assessment of potential medical factors affecting sleep\n",
       "\n",
       "This comprehensive plan addresses your specific challenges with evidence-based interventions. The key to success is consistency and patience, as your circadian system needs time to adjust to new patterns. Start with the foundational elements (consistent timing, phone removal, environment optimization) before adding advanced techniques.\n",

       "# Comprehensive Comparison: Strength Training vs. Deep Tissue Massage for Upper Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "## Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "Upper back pain affects millions of individuals worldwide, with treatment approaches ranging from active interventions like strength training to passive therapies such as deep tissue massage. While both approaches show promise in clinical settings, their effectiveness, mechanisms, and practical implementation differ significantly. This comprehensive analysis examines the evidence-based benefits and limitations of each treatment modality across multiple dimensions to guide clinical decision-making.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Strength Training for Upper Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effectiveness and Clinical Outcomes\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training demonstrates robust clinical evidence for treating upper back and neck pain. A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 89 studies involving 5,578 patients found that resistance training was among the most effective exercise interventions for chronic back pain, achieving an 80% SUCRA score for both physical function improvement (pooled standardized mean difference of -1.14, 95% CI: -1.71 to -0.56) and mental health outcomes (mean difference of -1.26, 95% CI: -2.10 to -0.41) [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "A randomized controlled trial with 20 sedentary male patients demonstrated that adding upper-extremity strengthening exercises to conventional programs produced superior outcomes. The supported exercise group showed significantly greater pain score reductions (3.8 points versus 2.7 points) and disability improvements (17.4 points versus 14.4 points decrease) compared to conventional exercise alone. Additionally, participants experienced a 34% increase in isometric extension strength [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "Workplace-based research involving 449 office workers found that one hour of specific strength training weekly effectively reduced neck and shoulder pain. Among participants with baseline pain ≥3, neck pain reduction ranged from 1.14 to 1.88 points on a 0-9 scale, which researchers considered clinically significant. The study demonstrated that training three times weekly for 20 minutes showed the most consistent benefits [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mechanisms of Action\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training addresses upper back pain through multiple physiological pathways. The spinal muscular kinetic chain concept demonstrates that exercises applied to the upper spine contribute to pain relief throughout the back. In patients with chronic back pain, the average EMG frequency of the thoracic erector spinae muscle is significantly reduced compared to healthy individuals, and targeted strengthening can restore normal function [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "The neurophysiological adaptations occur rapidly, with most initial strength improvements reflecting neural changes rather than muscle growth. During the first weeks of resistance training, the primary motor cortex shows reduced inhibition, decreased short-interval intracortical inhibition, and shorter cortical silent periods. These neural adaptations enhance motor unit recruitment and coordination, improving muscle function and reducing pain [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "Muscle protein synthesis increases following resistance exercise, with elevated myofibrillar protein synthesis rates initially directed toward muscle repair and later supporting muscular hypertrophy. Eccentric exercise (muscle lengthening under tension) induces greater mechanical tension on muscle fibers, leading to more rapid addition of sarcomeres both in series and parallel, ultimately improving strength and endurance [5].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Duration and Frequency Requirements\n",
       "\n",
       "Research indicates flexible scheduling options for strength training implementation. The office worker study found that three distinct approaches were effective: training once weekly for 60 minutes, three times weekly for 20 minutes, or nine times weekly for 7 minutes over 20 weeks. The three-times-weekly approach showed optimal results with 60% adherence compared to 49% for once-weekly training [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "A multicomponent intervention study demonstrated effectiveness with 12 weeks of strength training sessions lasting 45-60 minutes weekly, following 10 weeks of ergonomics training. Another successful protocol involved upper extremity strengthening performed three days per week for six weeks [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "For program design, specific parameters depend on training goals:\n",
       "- Strength development: >85% of 1RM, 2-6 sets, <6 reps, 2-5 minute rest\n",
       "- Hypertrophy: 67-85% of 1RM, 3-6 sets, 6-12 reps, 30-90 second rest\n",
       "- Muscular endurance: <67% of 1RM, 2-3 sets, >12 reps, <30 second rest [1]\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cost-Effectiveness and Accessibility\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training demonstrates excellent cost-effectiveness with consistent positive return on investment ratios of 1.15:1 to 1.7:1 and cost savings ranging from $121-$2,834 through reduced healthcare utilization. Group-based supervised exercise therapy, while costing an additional $531 annually compared to home-based exercise, reduces direct medical costs by $122 per year [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "Research suggests that gym-based exercise is more costly than home-based alternatives, with one supervised exercise intervention showing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AU$64,235. However, exercise interventions are considered cost-effective compared to manual therapy or massage due to minimal adverse effects and sustained benefits [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Safety Profile and Contraindications\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training has specific contraindications that must be considered. Individuals with previous spinal surgery, tumors, nerve root compression with neurological symptoms, spinal fractures, or infections may not be suitable candidates. Prolonged back pain can result in muscles with reduced mass, increased fatty content, and greater stiffness, potentially leading to easier fatigue and worsening pain initially [8].\n",
       "\n",
       "Eccentric exercise may cause nonuniform muscle activation changes, potentially leading to strength imbalances. Initial effects include muscle microlesions, temporary pain, reduced fiber excitability, and short-term weakness. One study reported a 38% dropout rate, indicating potential challenges with program adherence and completion [9].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Deep Tissue Massage for Upper Back Pain\n",
       "\n",
       "### Research Limitations\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite extensive searching, the available research specifically examining deep tissue massage for upper back pain is limited compared to strength training studies. Most massage research focuses on general massage therapy or combines multiple manual therapy techniques, making it difficult to isolate deep tissue massage effects specifically.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Mechanisms and Clinical Context\n",
       "\n",
       "While specific deep tissue massage studies are limited, research on thoracic manual therapy provides relevant insights. Manual therapy techniques work through neurophysiological mechanisms that produce short-term analgesia. A systematic review of thoracic manual therapy for subacromial pain syndrome found that when combined with thoracic extension exercises, results were more consistent and clinically meaningful than manual therapy alone [10].\n",
       "\n",
       "The neurophysiological effects of spinal manipulation and manual therapy appear to be primarily short-term, which suggests that deep tissue massage may provide temporary relief but requires ongoing treatment for sustained benefits [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comparative Analysis\n",
       "\n",
       "### Effectiveness and Evidence Quality\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training demonstrates superior evidence quality with multiple large-scale randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. The evidence base includes specific protocols, dosing parameters, and long-term outcome data. In contrast, specific research on deep tissue massage for upper back pain is limited, with most studies focusing on broader manual therapy categories.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Duration of Benefits\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training shows both immediate and long-term benefits. While initial neural adaptations occur within 3-4 weeks, sustained improvements in strength, endurance, and pain reduction continue with consistent training. Exercise programs can reduce the risk of new neck pain episodes by 53%, demonstrating significant preventive benefits [12].\n",
       "\n",
       "Research on thoracic manipulation indicates that manual therapy effects may not persist beyond 2 months after discontinuation, suggesting that passive treatments like deep tissue massage may require ongoing sessions to maintain benefits [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Cost Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training demonstrates superior long-term cost-effectiveness due to its preventive benefits and potential for self-directed implementation. Once proper technique is learned, individuals can continue strength training with minimal ongoing costs using basic equipment or bodyweight exercises.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep tissue massage typically requires professional administration, leading to higher ongoing costs without the same preventive benefits or self-management potential.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Practical Implementation\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training offers greater flexibility in implementation, with evidence supporting various scheduling options (1×60, 3×20, or 9×7 minutes weekly). It can be performed in multiple settings including home, workplace, or gym environments. However, it requires initial instruction on proper technique and progressive overload principles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep tissue massage requires trained practitioners and scheduled appointments, limiting accessibility and requiring ongoing financial investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Suitability for Different Pain Causes\n",
       "\n",
       "Strength training demonstrates broad applicability across various upper back pain causes:\n",
       "- Occupational pain: Highly effective for work-related postural issues and repetitive strain\n",
       "- Muscular weakness: Directly addresses underlying strength deficits\n",
       "- Postural dysfunction: Improves muscle balance and spinal alignment\n",
       "- Chronic pain conditions: Addresses both physical and neurophysiological aspects\n",
       "\n",
       "Deep tissue massage may be more suitable for:\n",
       "- Acute muscle tension and spasms\n",
       "- Immediate pain relief needs\n",
       "- Individuals unable to perform active exercise\n",
       "- Complementary treatment alongside other interventions\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recommendations for Combined Approaches\n",
       "\n",
       "The evidence suggests that combining active and passive treatments may provide optimal outcomes. Research on thoracic manual therapy combined with exercise shows superior results compared to either approach alone [10]. A combined approach might include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Initial deep tissue massage to address acute symptoms and muscle tension\n",
       "2. Progressive introduction of strength training exercises as tolerance improves\n",
       "3. Ongoing strength training for long-term management and prevention\n",
       "4. Periodic massage sessions for acute flare-ups or maintenance\n",
       "\n",
       "## Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on the available evidence, strength training demonstrates superior long-term effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and preventive benefits for upper back pain compared to deep tissue massage. The robust research base supporting strength training includes multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials showing significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life.\n",
       "\n",
       "While deep tissue massage may provide valuable short-term relief and could serve as a useful adjunct treatment, the limited specific research and temporary nature of benefits suggest it should not be the primary treatment approach. For optimal outcomes, individuals should prioritize strength training as the foundation of their treatment plan, potentially incorporating massage therapy for acute symptom management or as a complementary intervention.\n",
       "\n",
       "The flexibility of strength training protocols, combined with its preventive benefits and potential for self-management, makes it the more practical and sustainable choice for most individuals with upper back pain. However, the specific cause, severity, and individual circumstances should guide treatment selection, with healthcare providers helping to determine the most appropriate approach for each patient.\n",
